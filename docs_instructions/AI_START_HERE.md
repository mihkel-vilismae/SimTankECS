READ THIS .md FILE FIRST: `AI_START_HERE.md`! 

* AI_START_HERE.md
* COMMANDS.md
* AUTO_ACTIONS.md
* STYLE_GUIDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md

basically i want to make it so that:
i manually update the project instructions (if the instruction is not there). i add this line:

`READ the 'docs_instructions/AI_START_HERE.md' first and act accordingly.`

- **The process is like this:**
- i upload the project zip.
- there is the folder 'docs_instructions'

- in that folder are these 4 files:

`AI_START_HERE.md`
`COMMANDS.md`
`STYLE_GUIDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
`AUTO_ACTIONS.md`

- `COMMANDS.md` contains the commands i can use to interact with the project.
- `STYLE_GUIDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` contains the style guide for the project. set it as the project instructions. you must follow it strictly.
- `AUTO_ACTIONS.md` contains the auto actions you can take without me asking. 
for example, if i upload a new project zip, then automatically run the command `print quick folder list`. 
also, every time i run a prompt, then automatically add the line with the timestamp of giving the prompt as the first line in the answer.
